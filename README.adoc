== ANNOUNCEMENT: As of 1.1.0.RC1 / Avogadro.RC1 release, this project is now moved to link:https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters[spring-cloud-stream-app-starters] organization and each of the Spring Cloud Stream App Starters is now maintained in a separate repo by itself.

=== This change gives us the flexibility to bug-fix, update, and release individual applications independently as opposed to a time-consuming release of all the applications at once. The link:http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/docs/[reference guide] for all the releases are still available from the same location, though.

=== This project will not be actively tracked going forward.
- For any application specific issues, please find the respective repo under link:https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters[spring-cloud-stream-app-starters] organization and report it there. 
- For new feature requests, please use the common link:https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/app-starters-release/issues[spring-cloud-stream-app-starter/app-starters-release] project backlog.
